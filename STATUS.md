# MINTI — Project Status

> **Last updated:** 2026-05-26
> **Purpose:** Read this *first* when opening a new chat or onboarding to the project. It's the single document that tells you where MINTI is right now and how to pick up work without re-reading history.

---

## TL;DR

MINTI is a minimal, AI-agent-first Linux software stack plus a cross-OS **Clan protocol** for distributed local AI compute. We've completed **M0** (repo + protocol spec + install script) and **M1** (per-node AI runtime adapter), and validated the whole stack end-to-end on real Linux (WSL2 Debian 13). A persistent VirtualBox VM is configured as the primary dev/test environment. **M2 is next**: scaffold the five MCP servers and the first debian tool pack `minti-pack-recon`.

---

## Source of truth

The PRD is the authoritative spec. **Read it before any implementation work:**

- **Path:** `C:\Users\aouad\.claude\plans\hello-can-we-create-abundant-hopper.md`
- **Version:** **v0.6** (current)
- **Core principle (P1):** Open-source-first. MINTI never *depends* on a closed-source service. Default agent clients (`opencode`, OpenHands), default models (Hermes 3, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek), default runtime (Ollama / llama.cpp), and default transport are all open. Proprietary services (Claude Code, Anthropic API, OpenAI) are optional integrations users can choose to bring — never bundled, never required.
- **Other principles:** P2 (resurrection of dead hardware — installable on 1–2 GB old machines), P3 (PRD wins over clever-code).

## Current milestone

### Done ✅
- **M0** — Repo skeleton, Clan Protocol Spec v0.1 (`docs/clan-protocol.md`), `install.sh` v0
- **M1** — `runtime-adapter/` Go daemon. Backend interface + Ollama implementation + OpenAI-compatible + Ollama-compatible HTTP API, with systemd unit, config schema, install integration. Builds clean on Windows + cross-compiles to Linux amd64. All endpoints smoke-tested end-to-end.
- **Validation pass** — Full install + chat smoke test on real Debian 13 in WSL2. Two install bugs caught + fixed.
- **Dev environment** — Linux Mint 22.3 Xfce VM in VirtualBox with the entire MINTI stack installed.

### Next 🟡
- **M2 — MCP servers + first tool pack** (PRD §8, ~2 weeks part-time)
  - Five MCP servers under `mcp-servers/`: `fs`, `shell`, `recon`, `http`, `pkg`
  - First debian metapackage: `minti-pack-recon` (nmap, masscan, rustscan, whois, dnsx, naabu, amass, theHarvester) under `packs/recon/`
  - Each server is small + well-spec'd → **prime candidate for Tier-3 delegation** to local LLMs per the build workflow

### Future 🔲
- M3: Agent client integration (`opencode` bundled, Claude Code preset documented)
- M4: Clan Layer v1 — `cland` daemon (the iceberg, 4 weeks)
- M5: Cross-platform Clan Agent (Windows + macOS)
- M6: Security hardening + remaining packs (webapp, wireless, forensics) + Pack Manager
- M7: Old-hardware smoke test
- M8: v1.0 release

## How to resume work

### Single prompt to start the new chat

```
Continuing MINTI build. Read memory at
C:\Users\aouad\.claude\projects\C--Users-aouad-Documents-CCode-MINT-MINT-wip\memory\MEMORY.md
then read PRD at C:\Users\aouad\.claude\plans\hello-can-we-create-abundant-hopper.md
(v0.6) and STATUS.md in the repo root. M0+M1 are done. We start M2 —
MCP servers + minti-pack-recon. Pre-flight check the system first (per
my "check before you start" rule), then propose a task breakdown for
M2 with explicit T2-direct vs T3-delegable tagging before writing code.
```

### Repo location

- Path: `C:\Users\aouad\Documents\CCode\MINT\MINT_wip`
- Branch: `main`
- Remote: **none** (local-only by user choice; add later if publishing)

### Test environments (both currently powered off)

| Env | How to start | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **VirtualBox VM `minti-dev`** | `& "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" startvm minti-dev --type gui` (or `--type headless` for SSH-only) | Linux Mint 22.3 Xfce, 8 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs, 40 GB disk. Full MINTI stack installed. SSH to it via `ssh -i ~\.ssh\minti_vm -p 2222 minti@127.0.0.1` (passwordless). Passwordless `sudo` for `minti` user. Shared folder at `/media/sf_minti-repo` = the Windows-side repo (instant edit sync). NAT port-forwards: `127.0.0.1:2222→VM:22`, `127.0.0.1:17780→VM:7780`. |
| **WSL2 Debian 13** | `wsl -d Debian -u root` | Same MINTI stack installed. xrdp desktop attempted but flaky on WSL (known WSL artifact, not a MINTI bug — use the VM for desktop testing). |
| **Go toolchain (host)** | `$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Go\bin;$env:Path"; go version` | Installed system-wide via winget. 1.26.3. |

### Local LLMs available for delegation (host Ollama on RTX 5090)

Start Ollama on host with `& "C:\Users\aouad\AppData\Local\Programs\Ollama\ollama.exe" serve` (background). Models:

- `deepseek-r1:32b` (18.5 GB) — reasoning, has `<think>` traces
- `gemma4:31b` (18.5 GB) — strong general, also has thinking
- `qwen3.6:latest` (22.3 GB) — strong code, thinking-heavy

**Gotcha:** all three emit thinking traces. For code-gen delegation, set `num_predict ≥ 8000` and/or strip thinking. See `memory/reference_local_llms.md`.

### Build the runtime + run install.sh end-to-end

```powershell
# native build
cd C:\Users\aouad\Documents\CCode\MINT\MINT_wip
$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Go\bin;$env:Path"
cd runtime-adapter
go build -o minti-runtime.exe .\cmd\minti-runtime

# Linux cross-compile (for the VM)
$env:GOOS = "linux"; $env:GOARCH = "amd64"
go build -o dist\minti-runtime-linux-amd64 .\cmd\minti-runtime
$env:GOOS = ""; $env:GOARCH = ""

# Inside the VM (via SSH):
ssh -i ~\.ssh\minti_vm -p 2222 minti@127.0.0.1 "sudo bash /media/sf_minti-repo/install/install.sh"
ssh -i ~\.ssh\minti_vm -p 2222 minti@127.0.0.1 "curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7780/minti/health"
```

## What works right now (verified)

- `install.sh` runs end-to-end on a fresh Debian-family host: detects distro/arch/GPU/network, installs base packages + Ollama, creates `minti` system user, installs `minti-runtime` binary, writes default `/etc/minti/runtime.yaml`, enables + starts the systemd unit. Idempotent.
- `minti-runtime` daemon on `127.0.0.1:7780`:
  - `GET /minti/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
  - `GET /minti/version`, `GET /minti/capabilities` → static + live capability discovery
  - `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI shape, streaming + non-streaming) — translates to Ollama, proxies stream chunks back
  - `POST /api/chat` (Ollama-native passthrough)
  - `GET /v1/models`, `GET /api/tags` — model enumeration
- `minti-fetch` (bash) prints a colored ASCII logo + live system + runtime + Clan status (à la neofetch)
- Build is reproducible: `make runtime` (native), `make runtime-linux` (Linux amd64 cross-compile)

## Open questions / known issues

| | |
|---|---|
| MCP permission flow across Clan members | Spec'd in `docs/clan-protocol.md` §7; needs implementation in M2 |
| Reasoning-score rubric maintenance | YAML at `/etc/minti/reasoning-scores.yaml`, community-curated update channel in M6 |
| Tensor-parallel inference (model bigger than one node) | v2 — adopt exo or llama.cpp RPC |
| Cross-OS Clan Agent maintenance burden | Single Go binary, CI cross-builds — addressed in M5 |
| xrdp desktop in WSL2 | Known-flaky, not a MINTI issue. Use the VirtualBox VM for desktop dev. |
